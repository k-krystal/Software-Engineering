The document is about QUESTION PAPER GENERATOR AND EVALUATOR. The purpose of the product is to generate question papers and do their evaluation in an automated way. It will save the time and effort of the teachers. It will also help students to practice and revise regularly. Also, it is a secure process and it will prevent the leaking of question papers in the institutions. 

In this system we present a smart question paper generating system for universities. It is made to allow universities to generate question papers with random but even questions to cover most chapters of subject with difficulty level within seconds and mail them to colleges instantly. In our system we allow administrator to input a set of questions and respective answers for option ticking. We also allow admin to provide weight age and complexity for each of these questions. After thisthe questions are stored in database along with their weight age. Now on question paper generating time the admin just has to select the percentage of difficulty. On this selection the
system selects questions randomly in a way that their weightage makes up for 100 marks and according to difficulty that admin chooses the questions based on their complexity level. The questions are also added for various difficulty levels so that as soon admin chooses the type of paper difficulty (Easy, medium, difficult) the system automatically generates paper, prepares doc file as per selected paper format. Also emails it to other colleges. Evaluation is also done for the tests that the students give online. A database of marks is
maintained for teachers and students.

P.S- You will find all other details about design, constraints,diagrammatical representations of the implementation in the software requirement specifications document.
